<p>
	Java 3D is a new cross-platform API for developing 3D graphics
	applications in Java.  Its feature set is designed
	to enable quick development of complex 3D applications and, at
	the same time, enable fast and efficient implementation on a
	variety of platforms, from PCs to workstations.  Using Java 3D,
	software developers can build cross-platform applications that
	build 3D scenes programmatically, or via loading 3D content from
	VRML, OBJ, and/or other external files.  The Java 3D API includes
	a rich feature set for building shapes, composing behaviors,
	interacting with the user, and controlling rendering details.
<p>
	In this tutorial, participants learn the concepts behind
	Java 3D, the Java 3D class hierarchy, typical usage patterns,
	ways of avoiding common mistakes, animation and scene design
	techniques, and tricks for increasing performance and realism.
