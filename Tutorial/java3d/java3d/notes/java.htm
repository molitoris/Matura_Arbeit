These tutorial notes include dozens of separate Java applications illustrating
the use of Java 3D.  The source code for these applications is included in
files with <font color=#00FF00><tt>.java</tt></font> file name extensions.
Compiled byte-code for these Java files is <I>not included</I>!
To use these examples, you will need to compile the applications first.



<p>
<dt><font color=#FFFF00 size=+1><b>Compiling Java</b></font></dt>
<dd>
<p>
The source code for all Java 3D examples is in the
<font color=#00FF00><tt>examples</tt></font> folder.
Images, sound, and geometry files used by these examples are also
contained within the same folder.  A <font color=#00FF00><tt>README.txt</tt></font>
file in the folder lists the Java 3D applications included therein.
<p>
To compile the Java examples, you will need:
<p>
<ul>
	<li>The Java 3D API 1.1 class files (or later)
	<li>The Java JDK 1.2 (Java 2 Platform) class files (or later)
	<li>A Java compiler
</ul>
<p>
The JDK 1.2 class files are available for free from JavaSoft at
<a href="http://www.javasoft.com">http://www.javasoft.com</a>.
<p>
The Java 3D class files are available for free from Sun Microsystems at
<a href="http://www.sun.com/desktop/java3d">http://www.sun.com/desktop/java3d</a>.
<p>
There are multiple Java compilers available for most platforms.
JavaSoft provides the Java Development Kit (JDK) for free
from its Web site at
<a href="http://www.javasoft.com">http://www.javasoft.com</a>.
The JDK includes the <font color=#00FF00><tt>javac</tt></font> compiler
and instructions on how to use it.  Multiple commercial Java
development environments are available from Microsoft,
Symantec, and others.  An up to date list of available
Java products is available at Developer.com's Web site at
<a href="http://www.developer.com/directories/pages/dir.java.html">http://www.developer.com/directories/pages/dir.java.html</a>.
<p>
Once you have the Java API class files and a Java compiler, you
may compile the supplied Java files.  Unfortunately, we
can't give you explicit directions on how to do this.  Each platform
and Java compiler is different.  You'll have to consult your software's
manuals.

<p>
<dt><font color=#FFFF00 size=+1><b>Running the Java 3D Examples</b></font></dt>
<dd>
<p>
To run a Java application, you must run the Java interpreter and give it
the Java class file as an argument, like this:
<p>
<ul>
	<font color=#00FF00><tt>java MyClass</tt></font>
</ul>
<p>
The Java interpreter looks for the file
<font color=#00FF00><tt>MyClass.class</tt></font> in the
current directory and loads it, and any additional files needed by that
class.
