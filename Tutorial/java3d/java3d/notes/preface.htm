Welcome to these tutorial notes!
These tutorial notes have been written to give you a quick,
practical, example-driven overview of <i>Java 3D</i>, the cross-platform
3D graphics API for Java.
To do this, we've included almost 600 pages of tutorial material with
nearly 100 images and over 50 Java 3D examples.
<p>
To use these tutorial notes you will need:
<p>
<ul>
	<li>An HTML Web browser
	<li>Java JDK 1.2 (Java 2 Platform) or later
	<li>Java 3D 1.1 or later
</ul>
<P>
Information on Java JDKs and Java 3D is available at:

<p>
These tutorial notes primarily contain two types of information:
<p>
<ol>
	<li>General information, such as this preface
	<li>Tutorial slides and examples
</ol>
<p>
The tutorial slides are arranged as a sequence of 600+ hyper-linked
pages containing Java 3D syntax notes, Java 3D usage comments, or images of
sample Java 3D applications.  Clicking on the file name underneath an image
brings up a window showing the Java source file that generated the image.
The Java source files contain extensive comments providing
information about the techniques the file illustrates.
<P>
Compiling and executing the Java example file from the command-line brings up 
a Java application illustrating a Java 3D feature.  Most such applications
include menus and other interaction options with which you can explore
Java 3D features.
<p>
The tutorial notes provide a necessarily terse overview of Java 3D.
We recommend that you
invest in a Java 3D book to get thorough coverage of the language.
One of the course lecturers is an author of the Java 3D specification,
available from Addison-Wesley:  <i>The Java 3D API Specification</i>,
ISBN 0-201-32576-4, 1997.
